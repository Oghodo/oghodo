## Hi there 👋

## Welcome to my GitHub page!

My name is Oghodo Omoregbe, and I am a student at Brigham Young University–Idaho studying Software Development, as well as a student at University of Benin studying Anatomy. I am passionate about programming, computer science, data science, web development, and machine learning, and I strive to improve every day through projects and learning.

## About Me

I’m a passionate and goal-driven professional with a strong interest in software development and a growing background in both technology and anatomical sciences. Currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Software Development at Brigham Young University – Idaho (Mar 2025 – Apr 2027), I’m building hands-on experience in web development, front-end design, and programming using technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and C#.

Alongside this, I’m studying Anatomy at the University of Benin, where I’ve developed analytical and critical thinking skills that complement my problem-solving abilities in tech. I’m also a participant in BYU-Pathway Worldwide’s Certificate program in General Studies, which has strengthened my foundation in communication, teamwork, and professional skills, as well as my proficiency with Python and Microsoft Excel.

Professionally, I’ve served as an Executive Secretary at Ena Technologies Co., where I supported executive operations, managed financial reporting, and contributed to scholarship initiatives that empower students through education and technology.

I’m deeply motivated by opportunities that allow me to bridge technology, innovation, and service, building solutions that make a meaningful impact.
